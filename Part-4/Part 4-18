# 
Please write a function named mean, which takes a list of integers as an argument. The function returns the arithmetic mean of the values 

def mean(my_list):
    k = len(my_list)
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i<k:
        j = j+my_list[i]
        i=i+1
    result = float(j/k)
    return result

# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = [3, 6, -4]
    result = mean(my_list)
    print(result)
