# Please write a function named shape, which takes four arguments. The first two parameters specify a triangle, as above, and the character used to draw it. 
The first parameter also specifies the width of a rectangle, while the third parameter specifies its height. 
The fourth parameter specifies the filler character of the rectangle. 
The function prints first the triangle, and then the rectangle below it
