If the user types in a word for the second time, the program should print out the number of different words typed in, and exit.

Sample output
Word: once
Word: upon
Word: a
Word: time
Word: upon
You typed in 4 different words

l = list()
while True:
    word = input('Word ')
    if word in l:
        print('You typed in', len(l), 'different words')
        
        break
    else: 
        l.append(word)
