#Please write a program which initialises a list with the values [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. 
Then the program should ask the user for an index and a new value, replace the value at the given index, and print the list again. 
This should be looped over until the user gives -1 for the index. You can assume all given index values will fall within your list.

l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
while True:
    i = (input('Index'))
    if i == '-1':
        break
    else:
        n = input('New value')
        l[int(i)] = int(n)
        print(l)
