# Please write a function named distinct_numbers, which takes a list of integers as its argument. 
The function returns a new list containing the numbers from the original list in order of magnitude, and so that each distinct number is present only once.

def distinct_numbers(my_list):
    j = None
    distinct_numbers = list()
    for i in my_list:
        if i not in distinct_numbers:
            distinct_numbers.append(i)
    return (sorted(distinct_numbers))



if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = [3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1]
    print(distinct_numbers(my_list))
