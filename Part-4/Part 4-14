# Please write a program which asks the user to choose between addition and removal. 
Depending on the choice, the program adds an item to or removes an item from the end of a list. 
The item that is added must always be one greater than the last item in the list. The first item to be added must be 1.

The list is printed out in the beginning and after each operation. 

l = list()
print('The list is now', l)

while True:
    inp = input('a(d)d, (r)emove or e(x)it')
    if inp == 'd':
        
        n = int(len(l))
        
        l.append(n+1)
        print('The list is now', l)
        
    elif inp == 'r':
        n = len(l)
        l.remove(l[n-1])
        print('The list is now', l)
        

    elif inp == 'x':
        print('Bye!')
        break
