# Please write a function named list_sum which takes two lists of integers as arguments.
The function returns a new list which contains the sums of the items at each index in the two original lists. 
You may assume both lists have the same number of items.

def list_sum(a,b):
    list_sum = list()
    i = 0
    while i < len(a):
        m = a[i] + b[i]
        list_sum.append(m)
        i = i+1
    return(list_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = [7, 8, 9]
    print(list_sum(a, b))
