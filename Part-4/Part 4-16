# Please write a program which asks the user to type in values and adds them to a list. After each addition, the list is printed out in two different ways:

in the order the items were added
ordered from smallest to greatest
The program exits when the user types in 0.

l = list()
while True:
    i = int(input('New Item'))
    if i == 0:
        print('Bye!')
        break
    else:
        l.append(i)
        print('The list now:', l)
        print('The list in order:', sorted(l))
