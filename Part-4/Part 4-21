# Please write a program which asks the user for a positive integer N. 
The program then prints out all numbers between -N and N inclusive, but leaves out the number 0. Each number should be printed on a separate line.

n = int(input('Please enter an integer'))
for i in range(-n, n+1):
    if i != 0:
        print(i)
