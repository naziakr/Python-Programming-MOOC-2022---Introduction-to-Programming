# Please write a function named box_of_hashes, which prints out a rectangle of hash characters. 
The function takes one argument, which specifies the height of the rectangle. The rectangle should be ten characters wide.

The function should call the function line from the exercise above for the actual printing out. 


def line(a,b):
    if len(b)>1:
        b = b[0]
    elif b == "":
        b = "*"

    print(b*10)
# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    line(10, "")
def box_of_hashes(height):
    i = 0
    while i<height:
        line (height,"#")
        i += 1


# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    box_of_hashes(5)
