# Please write a function named lottery_numbers(amount: int, lower: int, upper: int), which generates as many random numbers as specified by the first argument.
All numbers should fall within the bounds lower to upper. The numbers should be stored in a list and returned. 
The numbers should be in ascending order in the returned list.

As these are lottery numbers, no number should appear twice in the list.

        number = randint(lower, upper)
        if number not in numbers:
            numbers.append(number)
 
    return sorted(numbers)
