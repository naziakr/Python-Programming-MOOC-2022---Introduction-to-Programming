# Please familiarize yourself with the Python module fractions. Use it to write a function named fractionate(amount: int), which takes the number of parts as its argument. 
The function should divide the number 1 into as many equal sized fractions as is specified by the argument, and return these in a list.

from fractions import Fraction

def fractionate(amount: int):
    fractions = []
    for i in range(amount):
        fractions.append(Fraction(1, amount))
    return fractions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for p in fractionate(3):
        print(p)

    print()
    print(fractionate(5)
