# The file start_times.csv contains individual start times for a programming exam, in the format name;hh:mm. An example:

jarmo;09:00
timo;18:42
kalle;13:23
Additionally, the file submissions.csv contains points and handin times for individual exercises. The format here is name;task;points;hh:mm. An example:

jarmo;1;8;16:05
timo;2;10;21:22
jarmo;2;10;19:15

Your task is to find the students who spent over 3 hours on the exam tasks. 
That is, any student whose any task was handed in over 3 hours later than their exam start time is labelled a cheater. 
There may be more than one submission for the same task for each student. You may assume all times are within the same day.

Please write a function named cheaters(), which returns a list containing the names of the students who cheated
