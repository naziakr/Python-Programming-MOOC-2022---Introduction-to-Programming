# Please write a program for recording the amount of time the user has spent in front of a television, computer or mobile device screen over a specific period of time.

The program should work as follows:

Sample output
Filename: late_june.txt
Starting date: 24.6.2020
How many days: 5
Please type in screen time in minutes on each day (TV computer mobile):
Screen time 24.06.2020: 60 120 0
Screen time 25.06.2020: 0 0 0
Screen time 26.06.2020: 180 0 0
