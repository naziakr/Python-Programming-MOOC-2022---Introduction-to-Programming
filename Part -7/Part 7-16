# In this exercise you will write an improved version of the Spell checker from the previous part.

Just like in the previous version, the program should ask the user to type in a line of text. 
Your program should then perform a spell check, and print out feedback to the user, so that all misspelled words have stars around them.
Additionally, the program should print out a list of suggestions for the misspelled words.

Please have a look at the following two examples.

Sample output
write text: We use ptython to make a spell checker

We use *ptython* to make a spell checker
suggestions:
ptython: python, pythons, typhon
Sample output
write text: this is acually a good and usefull program

this is *acually* a good and *usefull* program
suggestions:
acually: actually, tactually, factually
usefull: usefully, useful, museful
The suggestions should be determined with the function get_close_matches from the Python standard library module difflib.

from difflib import get_close_matches

def put_file_lines_in_list(file_name):
    with open(file_name) as file:
        file_as_list = []
        for line in file:
            line = line.replace('\n', '')
            file_as_list.append(line)
    return file_as_list

def main():
    text = input('Write text: ')
    text_list = text.split(' ')
    all_words = put_file_lines_in_list('wordlist.txt')
    for index, word in enumerate(all_words):
        all_words[index] = word.lower()
    output = ''
    misspelled_words = []
    for text in text_list:
        if text.lower() in all_words:
            output += text
        else:
            output += '*' + text + '*'
            misspelled_words.append(text)
        output += ' '
    print(output)
    
    print('suggestions:')
    for word in misspelled_words:
        close_matches = get_close_matches(word, all_words)
        close_matches = ', '.join(close_matches)
        print(f'{word}: {close_matches}')
        
main()
