# The exercise template contains the file words.txt, which contains some English language words, one on each line.

Please write a function named words(n: int, beginning: str), which returns a list containing n random words from the words.txt file. 
All words should begin with the string specified by the second argument.

The same word should not appear twice in the list. If there are not enough words beginning with the specified string, the function should raise a ValueError exception.

from random import sample

def words(n: int, beginning: str) -> list:
    found_words = []
    with open('words.txt') as word_file:
        for line in word_file:
            word = line.replace('\n', '')
            if word.startswith(beginning):
                found_words.append(word)

    if len(found_words) < n:
        raise ValueError(f'Could not find {n} words that start with {beginning}. Only found {len(found_words)} words.')
    
    return sample(found_words, n)
