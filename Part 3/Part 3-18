# Please write a program which asks the user to type in a string. 
The program then prints out all the substrings which end with the last character, from the shortest to the longest. Have a look at the example below.

Sample output
Please type in a string: test
t
st
est
test



int = input('Please type in a string:')
l = len(int)
i = 0
while i<=l:
    print(int[l-i:])
    i = i+1
