# Please write a program which asks the user to input a string. The program then prints out different messages if the string contains any of the vowels a, e or o.

You may assume the input will be in lowercase entirely. Have a look at the examples below.

Sample output
Please type in a string: hello there
a not found
e found
o found


str = input('Please type in a string')
if "a" in str:
    print("a found")
else:
    print ("a not found")
if "e" in str:
    print("e found")
else:
    print ("e not found")
if "o" in str:
    print("o found")
else: print ("o not found")
