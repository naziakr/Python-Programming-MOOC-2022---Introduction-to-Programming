# Please write a new version of the program in the previous exercise. In addition to the result it should also print out the calculation performed:

Sample output
Limit: 2
The consecutive sum: 1 + 2 = 3

limit = int(input("Limit:"))
num = 1
value = 1
x = "1"
while value < limit:
    num += 1
    value += num
    x += f" + {num}"
print(f"The consecutive sum: {x} = {value}")
