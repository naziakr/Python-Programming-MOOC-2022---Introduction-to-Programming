# Please write a program which asks the user for two strings and then prints out whichever is the longer of the two - that is, whichever has the more characters.
If the strings are of equal length, the program should print out "The strings are equally long".


s = input('Please type in string 1')
t = input('Please type in string 2')
l = len(s)
m = len(t)
if l ==m:
    print('The strings are equally long')
elif l<m:
    print(t, "is longer")
elif l>m:
    print(s, "is longer")
