# Please write a program which asks the user to type in a number. 
The program then prints out the positive integers between 1 and the number itself, alternating between the two ends of the range as in the examples below.

Sample output
Please type in a number: 5
1
5
2
4
3


n = int(input('A number'))
i = 1
if n%2 ==0:
    while i < n:
        print (i)
        print(n)
        i = i+1
        n = n-1
elif n%2 !=0:
    while i<n+1 and n!=i:
        print (i)
        print(n)
        i = i+1
        n = n-1
    print(i)
