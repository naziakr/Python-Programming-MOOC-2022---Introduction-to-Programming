# Please write a function named print_many_times(text, times), which takes a string and an integer as arguments. The integer argument specifies how many times the string argument should be printed out:

print_many_times("hi", 5)

print()

text = "All Pythons, except one, grow up"
times = 3
print_many_times(text, times)



def print_many_times(text, times):
    i = 0
    while i<times:
        print(text)
        i = i+1

# You can test your function by calling it within the following block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_many_times("python", 5)
