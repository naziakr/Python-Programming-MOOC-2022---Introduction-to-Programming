# Please write a program which asks the user for a positive integer number. 
The program then prints out a list of multiplication operations until both operands reach the number given by the user. 


n = int(input('Please type in a number'))
l = 1
while l<n+1:
    m = 1
    while m<n+1:
        print(f"{l} x {m} = {l*m}")
        m = m+1
    l = l+1
