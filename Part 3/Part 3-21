and which begin with the character specified by the user. You may assume the input string is at least three characters long.

Sample output
Please type in a word: mammoth
Please type in a character: m
mam

mot


word = input("Please type in a word: ")
char = input("Please type in a character: ")
i = 0

while i < len(word)-2:
    if word[i] == char:
        print(word[i:i+3])
    i += 1
