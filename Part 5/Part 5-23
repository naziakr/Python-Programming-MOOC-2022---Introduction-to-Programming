# Please write a function named create_tuple(x: int, y: int, z: int), which takes three integers as its arguments, and creates and returns a tuple based on the following
criteria:

The first element in the tuple is the smallest of the arguments
The second element in the tuple is the greatest of the arguments
The third element in the tuple is the sum of the arguments

def create_tuple(x: int, y: int, z: int):
    my_list = [x, y, z]

    smallest = min(my_list)
    greatest = max(my_list)
     
    tuple = (smallest, greatest, sum(my_list))

    return tuple


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(create_tuple(5, 3, -1))
