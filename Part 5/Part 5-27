# This final exercise in this part is a relatively demanding problem solving task. It can be solved in many different ways. Even though this current section in the material covers tuples, tuples are not necessarily the best way to go about solving this.

Please write a program which prints out a square of letters as specified in the examples below. You may assume there will be at most 26 layers.

Sample output
Layers: 3

CCCCC
CBBBC
CBABC
CBBBC
CCCCC
Sample output
Layers: 4

DDDDDDD
DCCCCCD
DCBBBCD
DCBABCD
DCBBBCD
DCCCCCD
DDDDDDD


n = int(input("Layers: "))
 
alphabets = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
 
left = ""    # section, that goes downwards
right = ""    # section, that goes upwards
k = n-1       # the location of next character in alphabets
m = 2*n-1     # the number of characters in between
while k >= 1:
    left = left+alphabets[k]
    right = alphabets[k]+right
    m -= 2
    print(left+alphabets[k]*m+right)
    k -= 1
while k <= n-1:
    print(left+alphabets[k]*m+right)
    left = left[:-1]
    right = right[1:]
    m += 2
    k += 1
