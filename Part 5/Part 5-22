# Please write a function named find_movies(database: list, search_term: str), which processes the movie database created in the previous exercise. 
The function should formulate a new list, which contains only the movies whose title includes the word searched for. Capitalisation is irrelevant here.
A search for ana should return a list containing both Anaconda and Management.

An example of its use:

database = [{"name": "Gone with the Python", "director": "Victor Pything", "year": 2017, "runtime": 116},
{"name": "Pythons on a Plane", "director": "Renny Pytholin", "year": 2001, "runtime": 94},
{"name": "Dawn of the Dead Programmers", "director": "M. Night Python", "year": 2011, "runtime": 101}]

my_movies = find_movies(database, "python")
print(my_movies)
Sample output
[{"name": "Gone with the Python", "director": "Victor Pything", "year": 2017, "runtime": 116}, 
{"name": "Pythons on a Plane", "director": "Renny Pytholin", "year": 2001, "runtime": 94}]


def find_movies(database: list, search_term: str):
    movies = []

    for movie in database:
        if search_term in movie['name'].lower():
            movies.append(movie)

    return movies
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    database = [{"name": "Gone with the Python", "director": "Victor Pything", "year": 2017, "runtime": 116},
    {"name": "Pythons on a Plane", "director": "Renny Pytholin", "year": 2001, "runtime": 94},
    {"name": "Dawn of the Dead Programmers", "director": "M. Night Python", "year": 2011, "runtime": 101}]

    my_movies = find_movies(database, "python")
    print(my_movies)
