#Please write a function named factorials(n: int), which returns the factorials of the numbers 1 to n in a dictionary. 
The number is the key, and the factorial of that number is the value mapped to it.

A reminder: the factorial of the number n is written n! and is calculated by multiplying the number by each integer smaller than itself.
For example, the factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.

def factorials(n):
    k = dict()
    f = 1 
    for i in range (1,n+1):
             
        f = f*i
        
        k[i] = f
            
       return(k)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    k = factorials(5)
    print(k[1])
    print(k[3])
    print(k[5])
