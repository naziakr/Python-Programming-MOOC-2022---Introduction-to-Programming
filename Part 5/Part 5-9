# Please write a function named remove_smallest(numbers: list), which takes a list of integers as its argument.

The functions should find and remove the smallest item in the list. You may assume there is a single smallest item in the list.

The function should not have a return value - it should directly modify the list it receives as a parameter.


def remove_smallest(numbers):
  
    r = min(numbers)
    print(r)
    for i in numbers:
        if i == r:
            numbers.remove(i)

    print(numbers)
  

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = [2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]
    remove_smallest(numbers)
