# Please write a function named add_movie(database: list, name: str, director: str, year: int, runtime: int), which adds a new movie object into a movie database.

The database is a list, and each movie object in the list is a dictionary. The dictionary should contain the following keys.

name
director
year
runtime
The values attached to these keys are given as arguments to the function.

An example of its use:

database = []
add_movie(database, "Gone with the Python", "Victor Pything", 2017, 116)
add_movie(database, "Pythons on a Plane", "Renny Pytholin", 2001, 94)
print(database)
Sample output
[{"name": "Gone with the Python", "director": "Victor Pything", "year": 2017, "runtime": 116}, 
{"name": "Pythons on a Plane", "director": "Renny Pytholin", "year": 2001, "runtime": 94}]


def add_movie(database: list, name: str, director: str, year: int, runtime: int):
    movie = {}
    movie = {"name" : name, "director" : director, "year" : year, "runtime" : runtime}
    database.append(movie)
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    database = []
    add_movie(database, "Gone with the Python", "Victor Pything", 2017, 116)
    add_movie(database, "Pythons on a Plane", "Renny Pytholin", 2001, 94)
