# Please write a function named longest(strings: list), which takes a list of strings as its argument.
The function finds and returns the longest string in the list. You may assume there is always a single longest string in the list.

    l = 0
    m = ""
    for i in strings:
        if len(i)>l:
            l = len(i)
            m = i

    return m




if __name__ == "__main__":
    strings = ["hi", "hiya", "hello", "howdydoody", "hi there"]
    print(longest(strings))
