# Please write a function named times_ten(start_index: int, end_index: int), which creates and returns a new dictionary. 
The keys of the dictionary should be the numbers between start_index and end_index inclusive

The value mapped to each key should be the key times ten.

    d = dict()
    j = 1
    for i in range(start_index, end_index+1):
        d[i] = i*10
        
    return d

if __name__ == "__main__":
    d = times_ten(3, 6)
    print(d)
