# Please write a function named transpose(matrix: list), which takes a two-dimensional integer array, i.e., a matrix, as its argument. 
The function should transpose the matrix. 
Transposing means essentially flipping the matrix over its diagonal: columns become rows, and rows become columns.

def transpose(matrix: list):
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(i, len(matrix)):
            temp = matrix[i][j]
            matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i]
            matrix[j][i] = temp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    print(matrix)
    transpose(matrix)
    print(matrix)
