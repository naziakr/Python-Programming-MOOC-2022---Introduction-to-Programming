# Please write a program which asks the user for an integer number. If the number is less than zero, the program should print out the number multiplied by -1. Otherwise the program prints out the the number as is. Please have a look at the examples of expected behaviour below.

Sample output
Please type in a number: -7
The absolute value of this number is 7

code:
num = input('Please type in a number')
if int(num)>0:
    print('The absolute value of this number is', num)
else:
    print('The absolute value of this number is', (-1)*int(num))
