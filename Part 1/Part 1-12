# This program already contains two integer variables, x and y:

x = 27
y = 15
Please complete the program so that it also prints out the following:

Sample output
27 + 15 = 42
27 - 15 = 12
27 * 15 = 405
27 / 15 = 1.8

The program should work correctly even if the values of the variables are changed.

code:
x = input('first number')
y = input('second number')
print(f'{x} + {y}= {x+y}')
print(f'{x} - {y}= {x-y}')
print(f'{x} * {y}= {x*y}')
print(f'{x} / {y}= {x/y}')
