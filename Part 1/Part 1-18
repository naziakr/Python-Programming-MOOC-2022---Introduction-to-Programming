# Please write a program which asks the user for four numbers. The program then prints out the sum and the mean of the numbers.

The program should function as follows:

Sample output
Number 1: 2
Number 2: 1
Number 3: 6
Number 4: 7
The sum of the numbers is 16 and the mean is 4.0

code:
one = input('Number 1:')
two = input('Number 2:')
three = input('Number 3:')
four = input('Number 4:')
s = int(one)+int(two)+int(three)+int(four)
m = float(s/4)
print('The sum of the numbers is', s, 'and the mean is', m)
