# In the Python math module there is the function sqrt, which calculates the square root of a number. You can use it like so:

from math import sqrt

print(sqrt(9))
This should print out

Sample output
3.0

code:
from math import sqrt
a = int(input("Value of a:"))
b = int(input("Value of b:"))
c = int(input("Value of c:"))

# Note that the square root can also be calculated using power.
# sqrt(9) is equivalent to 9 ** 0.5

x1 = (-b + sqrt(b ** 2 - (4 * a * c))) / (2 * a)
x2 = (-b - sqrt(b ** 2 - (4 * a * c))) / (2 * a)
print(f"The roots are {x1} and {x2}")
