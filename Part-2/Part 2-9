# Please write a program which asks for the user's name. If the name is Huey, Dewey or Louie, the program should recognise the user as one of Donald Duck's nephews.

In a similar fashion, if the name is Morty or Ferdie, the program should recognise the user as one of Mickey Mouse's nephews

if n=='Huey' or n=='Dewey' or n=='Louie':
    print("I think you might be one of Donald Duck's nephews.")
elif n=='Morty' or n=='Ferdie':
    print("I think you might be one of Mickey Mouse's nephews.")
else:
    print("You're not a nephew of any character I know of.")
