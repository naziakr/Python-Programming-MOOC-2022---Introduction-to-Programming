# Please write a program which asks the user for two words. The program should then print out whichever of the two comes alphabetically last.

You can assume all words will be typed in lowercase entirely.

a = input('Please type in the 1st word:')
b = input('Please type in the 2nd word:')
if a<b:
    print(a, 'comes alphabetically before', b)
elif b<a:
    print(b, 'comes alphabetically before', a)
elif a==b:
    print('You gave the same word twice')
