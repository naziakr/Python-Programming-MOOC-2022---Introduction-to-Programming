# Please write a program which asks for the user's age. 
If the age is not plausible, that is, it is under 5 or something that can't be an actual human age, the program should print out a comment.

if a<0:
    print('That must be a mistake')
elif a<5 and a>=0:
    print("I suspect you can't write quite yet...")
elif a>=5:
    print("Ok, you're", a, "years old")
