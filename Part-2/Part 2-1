 #correct the following core:
 
 number = input("Please type in a number: ")
 if number>100
    print("The number was greater than one hundred")
    number - 100
    print("Now its value has decreased by one hundred)
    print("Its value is now"+ number)
 print(number + " must be my lucky number!")
 print("Have a nice day!)
 
correct code:
number = input("Please type in a number: ")
if int(number)>100:
    print("The number was greater than one hundred")
    print("Now its value has decreased by one hundred")
    print("Its value is now", int(number) - 100)
    print(int(number) - 100, " must be my lucky number!")
    print("Have a nice day!")
if int(number)<=100:
    print(int(number), "must be my lucky number!")
    print("Have a nice day!")
