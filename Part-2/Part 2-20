# Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and prints out the next leap year.

Sample output
Year: 2023
The next leap year after 2023 is 2024

If the user inputs a year which is a leap year (such as 2024), the program should print out the following leap year:

Sample output
Year: 2024
The next leap year after 2024 is 2028


year = int(input("Year: "))

initial = year

while True:

    year += 1

    if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 and year % 400 != 0):
        break

    elif year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 == 0:
        break

print(f"The next leap year after {initial} is {year}")
