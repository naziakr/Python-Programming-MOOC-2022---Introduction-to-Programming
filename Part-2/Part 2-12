# Generally, any year that is divisible by four is a leap year. However, if the year is additionally divisible by 100, it is a leap year only if it also divisible by 400.

Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and then prints out whether that year is a leap year or not.

y = int(input('Please type in a year'))
if y%4 !=0:
    print('That year is not a leap year')
if y%4 ==0 and y%100 == 0:
    if y%400 == 0:
        print('That year is a leap year')
    else:
        print('That year is not a leap year')
if y%4 ==0 and y%100 != 0:
    print('That year is a leap year')
