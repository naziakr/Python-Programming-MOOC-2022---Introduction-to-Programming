# Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers.

If the number is below zero, the program should print out the message "Invalid number".

If the number is above zero, the program should print out the square root of the number using the Python sqrt function.

In either case, the program should then ask for another number.

If the user inputs the number zero, the program should stop asking for numbers and exit the loop.




from math import sqrt

while True:
    i = int(input('Please type in a number'))
    if i == 0:
        print('Exiting...')
        break
    elif i>0:
        print(sqrt(i))
    elif i<0:
        print('Invalid number')
