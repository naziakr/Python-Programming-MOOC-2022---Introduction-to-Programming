# Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is 4321. 
The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.

Sample output
PIN: 3245
Wrong
PIN: 1234
Wrong
PIN: 0000
Wrong
PIN: 4321
Correct! It took you 4 attempts

If the user gets it right on the first try, the program should print out something a bit different:

Sample output
PIN: 4321
Correct! It only took you one single attempt!



a = 0
p = input('PIN:')
a = a+1
if p != '4321':
    print('Wrong')
    while True:
        n = input('PIN')
        a = a+1
        if n == '4321':
            print('Correct! It took you', a, 'attempts')
            break
        else: print('Wrong')
elif p == '4321':
        print('Correct! It only took you one single attempt!')
