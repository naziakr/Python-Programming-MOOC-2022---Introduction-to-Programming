# Please write a program which asks for two integer numbers. The program should then print out whichever is greater. 
If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message.

a = int(input('Please type in the first number:'))
b = int(input('Please type in another number:'))
if a>b:
    print('The greater number was:', a)
elif a<b:
    print('The greater number was:', b)
elif a==b:
    print('The numbers are equal!')
