# Please write a function named store_personal_data(person: tuple), which takes a tuple containing some identifying information as its argument.

The tuple contains the following elements:

Name (string)
Age (integer)
Height (float)
This should be processed and written into the file people.csv. The file may already contain some data; the new entry goes to the end of the file. 
The data should be written in the format

name;age;height

Each entry should be on a separate line. 
If we call the function with the argument ("Paul Paulson", 37, 175.5), the function should write this line to the end of the file:

Paul Paulson;37;175.5


def store_personal_data(person: tuple):
    with open('people.csv', 'a') as file:
        person_data = []
        person_data.append(person[0])
        person_data.append(str(person[1]))
        person_data.append(str(person[2]))
        line = ';'.join(person_data) + '\n'
        file.write(line)
