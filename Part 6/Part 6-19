Sample data
week 1;5,7,11,13,23,24,30
week 2;9,13,14,24,34,35,37
...etc...

Each line should contain a header week x, followed by seven integer numbers which are all between 1 and 39 inclusive.

Lines in the file may contain the following kinds of errors (these exact lines may not be present in the file, but errors in a similar format will be):

The week number is incorrect:

The same number appears twice:

Please write a function named filter_incorrect(), which creates a file called correct_numbers.csv. 
The file should contain only those lines from the original file which are in the correct format.
