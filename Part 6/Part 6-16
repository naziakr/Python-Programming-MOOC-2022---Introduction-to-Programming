The program should work as follows:

The dictionary entries should be written to a file called dictionary.txt. The program should first read the contents of the file. 
New entries are written to the end of the file whenever they are added to the dictionary.

The format of the data stored in the dictionary is up to you.

NB: the automatic tests for this exercise may change the contents of the file. 
If you want to keep its contents, first make a copy of the file under a different name.

def add_to_dict(dict_file_name: str, finnish: str, english: str):
    with open(dict_file_name, 'a') as file:
        file.write(finnish + ';' + english + '\n')
    print('Dictionary entry added')

def search_dict(dict_file_name: str, search_term: str):
    search_term = search_term.lower()
    with open(dict_file_name) as file:
        for line in file:
            line = line.replace('\n','')
            line = line.strip()
            parts = line.split(';')
            finnish = parts[0].lower()
            english = parts[1].lower()
            if search_term in finnish or search_term in english:
                print(f'{finnish} - {english}')

def main():
    dict_file_name = 'dictionary.txt'
    while True:
        print('1 - Add word, 2 - Search, 3 - Quit')
        choice = int(input('Function: '))
        if choice == 1:
            finnish = input('The word in Finnish: ')
            english = input('The word in English: ')
            add_to_dict(dict_file_name, finnish, english)
        elif choice == 2:
            search_term = input('Search term: ')
            search_dict(dict_file_name, search_term)
        elif choice == 3:
            print('Bye!')
            break

main()
