# The file solutions.csv contains some solutions to mathematics problems:

Arto;2+5;7
Pekka;3-2;1
Erkki;9+3;11
Arto;8-3;4
Pekka;5+5;10
...jne...
As you can see above, on each line the format is name_of_student;problem;result. All the operations are either addition or subtraction, and each has exactly two operands.

Please write a function named filter_solutions() which

Reads the contents of the file solutions.csv
writes those lines which have a correct result into the file correct.csv
writes those lines which have an incorrect result into the file incorrect.csv
Using the example above, the file correct.csv would contain the lines

Arto;2+5;7
Pekka;3-2;1
Pekka;5+5;10
The other two would be in the file incorrect.csv.

Please write the lines in the same order as they appear in the original file. Do not change the original file.

NB: the function should have the exact same result, no matter how many times it is called. That is, it shouldn't matter if the function is called once
