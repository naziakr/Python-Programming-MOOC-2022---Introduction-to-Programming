# This exercise is about creating a program which allows the user to search for recipes based on their names, preparation times, or ingredients used. 
The program should read the recipes from a file submitted by the user.

Each recipe consists of three or more lines. The first line has the name of the recipe, the second line contains an integer number representing the preparation time
in minutes, and the remaining line or lines contain the ingredients used, one on each line. 
The recipe ends with an empty line, with the exception of the final recipe in the file which just ends with the end of the file. 
So, there can be more than one recipe in a single file, like in the example below.

Pancakes
15
milk
eggs
flour
sugar
salt
butter

Meatballs
45
mince
eggs
breadcrumbs

Tofu rolls
30
tofu
rice
water
carrot
cucumber
avocado
wasabi

Cake pops
60
milk
bicarbonate
eggs
salt
sugar
cardamom
butter

Search for recipes based on the name of the recipe
Please write a function named search_by_name(filename: str, word: str), which takes a filename and a search string as its arguments. The function should go through the file and select all recipes whose name contains the given search string. The names of these recipes are then returned in a list.

An example of the function in action:

found_recipes = search_by_name("recipes1.txt", "cake")

for recipe in found_recipes:
    print(recipe)
Sample output
Pancakes
Cake pops

As you can see in the example above, the case of the letters is irrelevant. 
The search term cake returns both Pancakes and Cake pops, even though the latter is capitalized.


Search for recipes based on the preparation time
Please write a function named search_by_time(filename: str, prep_time: int), which takes a filename and an integer as its arguments. 
The function should go through the file and select all recipes whose preparation time is at most the number given.

The names of these recipes are again returned in a list, but the preparation time should be appended to each name. Please have a look at the example below.

found_recipes = search_by_time("recipes1.txt", 20)

for recipe in found_recipes:
    print(recipe)
Sample output
Pancakes, preparation time 15 min

Please write a function named search_by_ingredient(filename: str, ingredient: str), which takes a filename and a search string as its arguments. 
The function should go through the file and select all recipes whose ingredients contain the given search string.

The names of these recipes are returned in a list just like in the second part, with the preparation time appended. Please have a look at the example below.

found_recipes = search_by_ingredient("recipes1.txt", "eggs")

for recipe in found_recipes:
    print(recipe)
Sample output
Pancakes, preparation time 15 min
Meatballs, preparation time 45 min
Cake pops, preparation time 60 min
