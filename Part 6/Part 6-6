# Now also the exam points awarded to each student are contained in a CSV file. The contents of the file follow this format:

id;e1;e2;e3
12345678;4;1;4
12345687;3;5;3
12345699;10;2;2
In the above example the student whose student number is 12345678 was awarded 4+1+4 points in the exam, which equals a total of 9 points.

The program should again ask the user for the names of the files. Then the program should process the files and print out a grade for each student.

Sample output
Student information: students1.csv
Exercises completed: exercises1.csv
Exam points: exam_points1.csv
pekka peloton 0
jaana javanainen 1
liisa virtanen 3

Each completed exercise is counted towards exercise points, so that completing at least 10 % of the total exercices awards 1 point, 
completing at least 20 % awards 2 points, etc. Completing all 40 exercises awards 10 points. The number of points awarded is always an integer number.

The final grade for the course is determined based on the sum of exam and exercise points according to the following table:

exam points + exercise points	grade
0-14	0 (fail)
15-17	1
18-20	2
21-23	3
24-27	4
28-	5
NB: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should not place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.

This exercise will continue from the previous one. Now we shall print out some statistics based on the CSV files.

Sample output
Student information: students1.csv
Exercises completed: exercises1.csv
Exam points: exam_points1.csv

name                          exec_nbr  exec_pts. exm_pts.  tot_pts.  grade
pekka peloton                 21        5         9         14        0
jaana javanainen              27        6         11        17        1
liisa virtanen                35        8         14        22        3
Each row contains the information for a single student. The number of exercises completed, the number of exercise points awarded, 
the number of exam points awarded, the total number of points awarded, and the grade are all displayed in tidy columns. 
The width of the column for the name should be 30 characters, while the other columns should be 10 characters wide.
