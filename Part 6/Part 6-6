Please write a program which asks the user to type in some text. Your program should then perform a spell check, and print out feedback to the user, 
so that all misspelled words have stars around them. Please see the two examples below:

Sample output
Write text: We use ptython to make a spell checker

We use *ptython* to make a spell checker
Sample output
Write text: This is acually a good and usefull program

This is *acually* good and *usefull* program
The case of the letters should be irrelevant to the functioning of your program.

The exercise template includes the file wordlist.txt, which contains all the words the spell checker should accept as correct.
