# Please write a program which works as a simply diary. The diary entries should be saved in the file diary.txt. 
When the program is executed, it should first read any entries already in the file.

NB: the automatic tests for this exercise will change the contents of the file. If you want to keep its contents, first make a copy of the file under a different name.

The program should work as follows:

Sample output
1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit
Function: 1
Diary entry: Today I ate porridge
Diary saved

1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit
Function: 2
Entries:
Today I ate porridge
1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit
Function: 1
Diary entry: I went to the sauna in the evening
Diary saved

1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit
Function: 2
Entries:
Today I ate porridge
I went to the sauna in the evening
1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit
Function: 0
Bye now!

When the program is executed for the second time, this should happen:

Sample output
1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit
Function: 2
Entries:
Today I ate porridge
I went to the sauna in the evening
1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit
Function: 0
Bye now!



def read_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name) as diary:
        print('Entries:')
        for line in diary:
            print(line.replace('\n', ''))
        diary.close()

def update_file(file_name, entry):
    with open(file_name, 'a') as diary:
        diary.write(entry + '\n')
        diary.close()

while True:
    print('1 - add an entry, 2 - read entries, 0 - quit')
    choice = int(input('Function: '))
    if choice == 1:
        entry = input('Diary entry: ')
        update_file('diary.txt', entry)
        print('Diary saved')
    elif choice == 2:
        read_file('diary.txt')
    elif choice == 0:
        print('Bye now!')
        break
